    // This is related to the topic of threading rules:
    //  - it's ok to read data with a read lock or on event dispatch thread (aka EDT or UI thread)
    //  - it's ok to modify data with a write lock and only on EDT

    // In practice, it's not very complicated because actions run on EDT and can read any data.
    // So the only thing to remember is to use commands for modifications.

    // See also https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/threading-model.html
    // and javadoc for the Application class https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/platform/core-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/application/Application.java
    // Note that IntelliJ documentation is talking about read/write "actions" which is
    // an overloaded term and is not directly related to AnAction class.
